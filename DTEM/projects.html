            <p>This documentary focuses on misconceptions within the rising second hand clothing market, specifically in NYC. We investigated the reality of the industry, breaking down its negative effects.<p>
            <p>Oftentimes, purchasing and donating second hand clothing is viewed as a solution to our massive textile waste problem that contributes to global warming.</p>
            <p>By talking to a textile insider and conducting research, we learned that used clothing is just another contributing factor, not a solution, to our world’s textile waste problem.
            <p>My project partner, Nora, and I took a trip to Fabscrap in Brooklyn, which recycles textiles leftover from the clothing manufacturing process. They sell it in their store, where makers can purchase fabric at discounted prices. We volunteered throughout the morning, sorting a small portion of the piles of textiles Fabscrap receives form companies. Then, we interviewed Erin Wiens, the Fabscrap Community Lead. She talked to us about the Fabscrap process, misconceptions about textile waste and used clothing, and ways that individuals can make a positive difference. 
            <p>We also explored thrift stores throughout the city to learn more about peoples’ shopping habits. We gathered street interviews outside of L Train in the East Village, where we received the consensus that most people view thrifting as a more sustainable alternative to shopping  fast fashion.
            <p>Then, we edited our films separately to convey our message: thrift shopping is not a solution to the textile waste problem. It is a symptom and factor. Rather, we should learn to mend and reuse our textiles.
